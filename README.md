# Interactive Stock Data Dashboard

This project is an interactive stock data visualization dashboard built with Python, Dash, Plotly, and yFinance. It allows users to enter stock ticker symbols, select different timeframes, and visualize real-time stock prices, including candlestick charts with multiple moving averages. The app also displays detailed company information and financial metrics such as revenue, net income, and P/E ratio in an organized, modern layout with customizable styles.

Key Features:

Dynamic stock ticker input with real-time data fetching

Selection of different timeframes (1 month to max)

Candlestick charts with 10, 50, and 200-day moving averages

Financial summaries and metrics are displayed in responsive columns

Modular, clean, and customizable frontend with Bootstrap styling

(To run the dashboard, you will have to use your own device, but a screenshot of the dashboard is attached below as well)
